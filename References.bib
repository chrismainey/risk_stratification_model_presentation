	abstract = {Objectives: To ascertain hospital inpatient mortality in England and to determine which factors best explain variation in standardised hospital death ratios. Design: Weighted linear regression analysis of routinely collected data over four years, with hospital standardised mortality ratios as the dependent variable. Setting: England. Subjects:Eight million discharges from NHS hospitals when the primary diagnosis was one of the diagnoses accounting for 80\% of inpatient deaths. Main outcome measures: Hospital standardised mortality ratios and predictors of variations in these ratios. Results: The four year crude death rates varied across hospitals from 3.4\% to 13.6\% (average for England 8.5\%), and standardised hospital mortality ratios ranged from 53 to 137 (average for England 100). The percentage of cases that were emergency admissions (60\% of total hospital admissions) was the best predictor of this variation in mortality, with the ratio of hospital doctors to beds and general practitioners to head of population the next best predictors. When analyses were restricted to emergency admissions (which covered 93\% of all patient deaths analysed) number of doctors per bed was the best predictor. Conclusion: Analysis of hospital episode statistics reveals wide variation in standardised hospital mortality ratios in England. The percentage of total admissions classified as emergencies is the most powerful predictor of variation in mortality. The ratios of doctors to head of population served, both in hospital and in general practice, seem to be critical determinants of standardised hospital death rates; the higher these ratios, the lower the death rates in both cases.\%U http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/318/7197/1515.full.pdf},

	doi = {10/gb3r9t},
	abstract = {Objectives To develop a transparent and reproducible measure for hospitals that can indicate when deaths in hospital or within 30 days of discharge are high relative to other hospitals, given the characteristics of the patients in that hospital, and to investigate those factors that have the greatest effect in changing the rank of a hospital, whether interactions exist between those factors, and the stability of the measure over time.Design Retrospective cross sectional study of admissions to English hospitals.Setting Hospital episode statistics for England from 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2010, with linked mortality data from the Office for National Statistics.Participants 36.5 million completed hospital admissions in 146 general and 72 specialist trusts.Main outcome measures Deaths within hospital or within 30 days of discharge from hospital.Results The predictors that were used in the final model comprised admission diagnosis, age, sex, type of admission, and comorbidity. The percentage of people admitted who died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge was 4.2\% for males and 4.5\% for females. Emergency admissions comprised 75\% of all admissions and 5.5\% died, in contrast to 0.8\% who died after an elective admission. The percentage who died with a Charlson comorbidity score of 0 was 2\% in contrast with 15\% who died with a score greater than 5. Given these variables, the relative standardised mortality rates of the hospitals were not noticeably changed by adjusting for the area level deprivation and number of previous emergency visits to hospital. There was little evidence that including interaction terms changed the relative values by any great amount. Using these predictors the summary hospital mortality index (SHMI) was derived. For 2007/8 the model had a C statistic of 0.911 and accounted for 81\% of the variability of between hospital mortality. A random effects funnel plot was used to identify outlying hospitals. The outliers from the SHMI over the period 2005-10 have previously been identified using other mortality indicators. Conclusion The SHMI is a relatively simple tool that can be used in conjunction with other information to identify hospitals that may need further investigation.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

  abstract = {The UK Biobank (UKB) is a large cohort study of considerable empirical importance to fields such as medicine, epidemiology, statistical genetics, and the social sciences, due to its very large size (∼ 500,000 individuals) and its wide availability of variables. However, the UKB is not representative of its underlying sampling population. Selection bias due to volunteering (volunteer bias) is a known source of confounding. Individuals entering the UKB are more likely to be older, to be female, and of higher socioeconomic status. Using representative microdata from the UK Census as a reference, we document significant bias in estimated associations due to non-random selection into the UKB. For some associations, volunteer bias in the UKB is so severe that estimates have the opposite sign. E.g., older individuals in the UKB tend to be in better health. To aid researchers in correcting for volunteer bias in the UKB, we construct inverse probability weights based on UK census microdata. The use of these weights in weighted regressions reduces 78\% of volunteer bias on average. Our inverse probability weights will be made available.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute On Aging of the National Institutes of Health (RF1055654 and R56AG058726), the Dutch National Science Foundation (016.VIDI.185.044), and the Jacobs Foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
