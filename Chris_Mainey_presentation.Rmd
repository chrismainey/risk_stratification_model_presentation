## How risk stratification models could be used to improve health outcomes in the NHS


???

How you think risk stratification models could be used to improve health outcomes in the NHS

---

## What is risk-stratification?
+ Stratification (grouping or sorting) of population according to the risk of an event, usually determined by expert opinion, rule sets or statistical estimation of frequency based on correlated predictors.

--

### Benefits for health outcomes

+ Quantified individual risk can allow for more personalised care in many settings

--

+ Understanding distribution of needs
  + Commissioning the right sized services to meet needs
  + Planning and delivering service in a way that is accessible or appropriate to the population

--

+ Monitoring: 
  + Allow closer monitoring of high risk patients (e.g. diabetes patients and foot-care).
  + Change in risk can itself be a trigger for intervention
  + Quality / Outcome monitoring

???

These tools use relationships in historic population data to estimate the use of 
health care services for each member of a population. Risk stratification tools can be useful both 
for population planning purposes (known as “risk stratification for commissioning”) and for 
identifying which patients should be offered targeted, preventive support (known as “risk 
stratification for case finding”).

## How to evaluate whether the risk stratification model(s) are reliably predicting population vs. individual risks

???

How you would evaluate whether the risk stratification model(s) was reliably predicting population vs. individual risks

> _"...Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad..."_ `r Citep(bib, "Box1")`

--

### Assessing models

+ Models generally built for global accuracy (may or may not be population)

+ Understanding metrics:
  + AUC / R<sup>2</sup> global proportion of variance explained
  + MSE / RMSE / MAE - average errors per observation
  
--

### Validation in the population

+ Sub-group / marginal analysis
  + Understand where fit is poor
  + Class imbalance
  
+ Population weighting to assess fit e.g.`r Citep(bib, "vanaltenReweightingUKBiobank2022", .opts = list(max.names=2))`

> _"...The right balance between productivity and equity is a value judgement. The decision will 
rest with ICBs, but a sensible one will engage with its population, their representatives 
and its staff and explore the trade-offs they may be willing to make..."_ `r Citep(bib, "Wyatt1")`

.pull-left[
### Context
Awareness system you are working in and limitations


### Validation
+ Is this appropriate for your specific population / system?
+ Has it been tested in you population?
]

.pull-right[
### Monitoring

+ Change of usecase, e.g.:
  + Charlson score `r Citep(bib, "charlsonNewMethodClassifying1987", .opts = list(max.names=2))`
  + NEWS2 for COVID-19 patients `r Citep(bib, "carrEvaluationImprovementNational2021", .opts = list(max.names=2))`
+ Model drift / retraining
+ Interaction with other metrics



### Communication / engagement

+ Stakeholder engagement
+ Model, scope and limitations clear?
+ How can you take feedback?
